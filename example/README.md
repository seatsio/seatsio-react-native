# How to run the examples

Note: Before running the examples, you will need to run `yarn build` (or `yarn start`) in the project root folder. Once complete, the `dist` folder should be populated.

You can then run `yarn` to install the package dependencies, and `yarn ios` or `yarn android` depending on which system you will be testing.
